A package for supplying custom backends for libgit2 for use with the pygit2
package. Given a backend configuration, will create a pygit2 repository that
accesses that database.

There is no support for full emulation of "normal" git repos, for example the
storage of configuration or features such as hooks. Such support is unlikely
to ever occur, as the aim of custom backends it to provide storage engines for
the data in git rather than fully emulating git itself.

NB: compilation has only been tested on a ubuntu 14.4 machine I have handy
